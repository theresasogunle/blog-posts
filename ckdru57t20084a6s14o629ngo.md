## A Guide to Testing React Custom Hooks.



##  What are React Hooks ?
Hooks are a new addition in React 16.8. They let you use state and other React features without writing a class. Click [here](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html)  to learn more about react hooks.


### React Custom Hooks

Traditionally in React, we’ve had two popular ways to share stateful logic between components: render props and higher-order components. Custom Hooks solve many of the same problems without forcing you to add more components to the tree.
Another advantage of using custom hooks is that it lets you extract component logic into reusable functions so you don't have a long line of codes inside your component.
In this article, we will be creating a custom hook useEncryption and then write a few tests for it. See the entire code this article  [here](https://github.com/theresasogunle/useEncryption).

### useEncryption Custom Hook

useEncryption is a simple library built on  [Crypto JS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/crypto-js)  to enable Functional React components to decrypt and encrypt data. Few test will be written for this simple custom hook.

Let's get coding!


Open your terminal and paste this command to create a new react-app:

> npx create-react-app useEncryption


As earlier stated, we will be using the [Crypto JS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/crypto-js) library. You can grab it and then install it using


> yarn add crypto-js


Open src folder, create a new file and name it useEncryption.js file. Copy and paste this lines of code below in the newly created useEncryption.js file.



```
import CryptoJS from "crypto-js";

const useEncryption = (key) => {

  const encryptData = (data) => {
    return CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(data, key).toString();
  };

  const decryptData = (encryptedData) => {
    const bytes = CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(encryptedData, key);
    return bytes.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Utf8);
  };
  return {
    encryptData,
    decryptData,
  };
};
export default useEncryption;
``` 

### Explanation

The useEncryption hook takes a key as a parameter. The key is an encryption key private to anyone using this custom hook to encrypt and decrypt data .  We are also exposing two functions, the **encryptData** and the **decryptData** to enable the user of this hook have access to its functionality.


In index.js

> export { default as useEncryption } from './useEncryption';

We have a basic implementation of encryption and decryption using a custom hook, so let's write test with  [react-testing-library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro) 

### Tests

Let's install all the packages we need to test our custom hook as a dev dependency, using yarn 

> yarn add -D @testing-library/react
> yarn add -D @testing-library/react-hooks
> yarn add -D @testing-library/user-event


In src, create a folder and name it tests and then in the folder, create a file named useEncryption.test.js. We are going to write a test to determine if the custom hook functions do what we expect of it.

In useEncryption.test.js


```
import { renderHook, act } from "@testing-library/react-hooks";
import useEncryption from "../useEncryption";
const encryptionKey = ";.xy.se.";

test("it should encrypt a string", () => {

  const { result } = renderHook(() => useEncryption(encryptionKey));
  let dataTobeEncrypted = "hello";
  let encryptedData;
  act(() => {
    encryptedData = result.current.encryptData(dataTobeEncrypted);
  });

  expect(encryptedData).toHaveLength(44);
});

test("it should decrypt a string", () => {
  const { result } = renderHook(() => useEncryption(encryptionKey));
  let dataTobeEncrypted = "hello";
  let encryptedData;
  let decryptedData;
  act(() => {
    encryptedData = result.current.encryptData(dataTobeEncrypted);
  });

  act(() => {
    decryptedData = result.current.decryptData(encryptedData);
  });

  expect(decryptedData).toBe(dataTobeEncrypted);
});
``` 


Note:

In the code snippet above, Create React App uses Jest as its test runner, renderHook is used to simulate the custom hook and the functions derived from the custom hook. 
Act is used to simulate a user-event as seen above. See: [act](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/api#act).

We run the tests running this command in the terminal

> yarn test

All our tests should be passing. Tada!! You can reach out to me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/omo_mimie) should you have any questions!

We're done (for now). In cases where we use our custom hooks to extract component’s logic, the tests are written a little bit differently in scenarios where the component that uses the custom hook is a child of a higher order component (E.g Redux Provider). I’ll be writing extensively on that in my next article.

I'm open to ways of improving my write-ups. Please let me know!
