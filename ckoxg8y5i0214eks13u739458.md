## What is Machine Learning ? 

Machine Learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that provides computers,  the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine Learning uses mathematical algorithms that allow machines to learn. Machine learning is a way of solving problems through **identification**, **classification** or **prediction**.

## What is Deep Learning ?

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning which is very similar to machine learning but uses several algorithms. Deep learning is widely accepted mostly because of the way it handles feature/attributes engineering. Feature engineering simply involves extracting and categorizing of features in the data. Feature engineering is a key step in the model building process. Feature engineering is automated in deep learning models which is manually done in machine learning models.

### Machine Learning Algorithms

Every Machine Learning algorithm learns the mapping from an input to output. Machine Learning algorithms are mathematical algorithms that allows machines to learn by imitating how humans learn.

There are 3 types of Machine Learning Algorithms:

- Supervised learning- A dependent output depends on a set out independent variables. Examples of mathematical concepts used are: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, Logistic Regression etc.

- Unsupervised learning - No target or outcome variable to predict. It is used for clustering population in different groups, which is widely used for segmenting customers in different groups for specific intervention. Examples of Unsupervised Learning: Apriori algorithm, K-means. It can be used to build recommendation systems on e-commerce websites.

- Reinforcement learning - The machine is exposed to an environment where it trains itself continually using trial and error. It learns from past experience and tries to capture the best possible knowledge to make accurate business decisions. E.g self driving cars.


### Deep Learning Algorithms ?

Deep learning algorithms train machines by learning from examples. Deep learning is an automatic algorithm that uses neural network architecture like the human brain. It is composed of several mathematical algorithms. 

There are 3 types of neural networks that form the basis for most models in deep learning:

    
-  Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) - It uses an activation function in it's neurons that makes it powerful. Each node or neuron can be a logistic regression algorithm. It has a group of multiple neurons at each layer. It can be used to solve problems related to Tabular data, Image data and text data. 

-  Convolution Neural Networks (CNN)- CNN learns the filters automatically and it's able to get pixel data information.  These filters help in extracting the right and relevant features from the input data. It is specifically used to solve image data and can be used to get the difference between two images.

-  Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)- A looping constraint on the hidden layer of ANN turns to RNN. This looping constraint ensures that sequential information is captured in the input data. It can be used to solve Time Series data, Text data and Audio data.


Deep learning and machine learning are areas that enhance artificial intelligence and they are really making the world a better place. I have described the difference between both concepts and how they can be applied. Hopefully, this helps a machine learning newbie.
